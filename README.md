Charles Lowde's Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I'm Charles Lowde. I have recently graduated from the Data Analytics course at General Assembly. My background is in electrical engineering, I worked 10 years at one of Australiaâ€™s biggest electricity distributors. I am changing careers to something that excites me more, in Data Analytics. I enjoy the puzzle of getting the data I need in the form I need it, and I like digging into the data to discover new insights that I can communicate to make a difference.

## Black Dog Institute Fundraising Dashboard and Presentation
The capstone project for my Data Analytics course at General Assembly was to investigate two years of data for BDI's One Foot Forward fundraiser. I cleaned and feature-engineered the data with Python, and used Power BI for visualisations and the dashboard, as requested by BDI. The presentation was well recived by the client.
