# Charles Lowde's Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I'm Charles Lowde. I have recently graduated from the Data Analytics course at General Assembly. My background is in electrical engineering, I worked 10 years at one of Australiaâ€™s biggest electricity distributors. I am changing careers to something that excites me more, in Data Analytics. I enjoy the puzzle of getting the data I need in the form I need it, and I like digging into the data to discover new insights that I can communicate to make a difference.

## Black Dog Institute Fundraising Dashboard and Presentation
The capstone project for my Data Analytics course at General Assembly was to investigate two years of data for Black Dog Institute's One Foot Forward fundraiser. Black Dog Institute (BDI) asked for a variety of questions they had about the data to be answered with a presentation and a dashboard. I cleaned and feature-engineered the data with Python, and used Power BI for visualisations and the dashboard, as requested by BDI. I gave the presentaion which was well recived by the client. BDI gave perssion for me to add the presentaion slides and dashboard to my portfolia so please find them below. The recommnedations I made to BDI based on the data include:
- Encourage social interactions, as these are the biggest indicators of high amounts raised.
- Encourage aiming for 100km, as this also significatly increases the amout raised on average.
- Market into less engaged states, as there is huge variation average per capita raised
- Leverage local community success, as some postcodes have had a very high amount raised per capita, so events would likely be well supported.

## Divvy Bikes Analysis and Presentation
Another project I did for the Data Analytics course at General Assembly involved investigating data from Chicago's bike share program, and presenting my findings. I used PostgreSQL to access the database provided. Joins and unions were required to combine the multiples tables, depending on the information required. I looked into various aspect of the bike share program, but concentrated on how new bikes perfomed compared to older bikes. This included looking at how often each bike was being relocated, indicated by a trip starting at a different location to that bikes previous end location. Checking this required the use of window functions in SQL.
I performed the analysis for this project in Excel, with the presentation in PowerPoint. I have attached the presentation below. I found that newer bikes had only two-thirds as many relocations, suggesting much less maintanence required. Overall I noted that new bikes delivered ongoing benefits:
- Clear customer preference
- Likely improve customer satisfaction
- Opportunity to deliver improved product
- Reduced service cost
